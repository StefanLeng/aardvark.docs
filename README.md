# Introduction
**Aardvark is an open-source research platform for real-time graphics and visualization.**

As a research platform, Aardvark has a very strong emphasis on advancing the state-of-the-art in rendering and visualization systems. Some unique features include
* a fully incremental rendering VM,
* semantic composition of language-integrated shaders, and
* elm-style application development.

Based on a functional-first programming paradigm, Aardvark is one of the most efficient platforms in terms of raw rendering performance,  throughput, resource consumption, and rapid prototyping of complex visualization applications.

Aardvark is also used in industrial-scale real-world systems. It routinely handles terabytes of data, integrates sophisticated computer vision, graphics, and data management algorithms, and drives complex workflows and user interfaces.
